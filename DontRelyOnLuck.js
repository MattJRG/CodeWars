// Description

/*
The test fixture I use for this kata is pre-populated.

It will compare your guess to a random number generated using:

Math.floor(Math.random() * 100 + 1)
You can pass by relying on luck or skill but try not to rely on luck.

"The power to define the situation is the ultimate power." - Jerry Rubin

Good luck!

// Code

/*

Math.floor = function () {
  return 10;
}

const luckyNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100 + 1)

var guess = 10

console.log(luckyNumber == guess)
